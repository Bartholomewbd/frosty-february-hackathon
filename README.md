## What is Frosty February?

Welcome to Frosty February, an inaugural (first time) event! Which we aim to make a yearly Hackathon event for the Zero To Mastery community. So how does it work?

**There are 6 projects, being led by some of your awesome Star Mentors in the Discord community. Each mentor will spend the month of February leading his or her team to complete the project they have designed to present back to the community on February 29th 2020!**

The goal is to gain experience working in teams, and building something together by the end of the month that you can be proud of and even hopefully put on your resume!

## How To Join A Project!

To make the projects manageable, the project teams are limited to 10 team members. Ensuring that you have enough free time you can dedicate to the project, clicking the `join` link on the project you would like to join from the list below. This will take you to your chosen projects dedicated discord channel, now simply enter `-joinproject` to sign up.

> A fun, beginner-friendly challenge.
> What can you come up with, using plain **HTML** and **CSS**? This year, our theme is "Animation Nation"! Unleash your creativity and show us your best work - it can be as simple or complex as you'd like, all we ask is that you use only HTML and pure CSS, and include at least one animation. All work will be proudly displayed on the site for other students to admire. Let's showcase the artistry of ZTM students!

# New To Opensource Projects

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.

# One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
